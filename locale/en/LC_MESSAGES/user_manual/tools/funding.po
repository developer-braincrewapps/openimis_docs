msgstr "Access to the ``Funding`` is restricted to the users with the system role of Accountant or with a role including an access to Tools/Funding."

msgid "The ``Funding`` is the place where funding from external authorities (payers) can be for entered. openIMIS creates internally one fictive family/group (the insurance number of the head of the fictive family/group is 999999999, the name is *Funding* and the other name is *Funding* as well) for the district for which a funding is done. Each entering of a fund results in creation of a fictive policy for the corresponding fictive family/group with paid contribution in the amount of the funding. The fictive policy is active since the date of payment of the corresponding fund. These fictive policies are overpaid as these funds are usually much higher than the contribution rate for a single family/member of the group but it doesn’t matter. External funding corresponds to payment of contributions for many families/members of the group in some period. openIMIS can regard funds as standard contributions and its standard functionality can be used for handling of funds. One distinctive feature of payment of funds by means of the fictive policies is that the payments of funds don’t appear in the reports on matching funds generated for funding authorities. So, there is no danger that offices of the scheme administration would acquire new funds based on funding already acquired."
