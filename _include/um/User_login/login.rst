  The full menu is displayed; Clicking on the menu headers will display a sub-menu providing further navigation options. Menus with a blue fore-colour are accessible, while menus with a grey fore-colour are disabled; either due to access rights of a user or unavailable functionality. Below the main menu at the top left-hand corner there is information about the current login user: Login Name, a list of roles acquired by the user and the districts to which the user has access.

  When a password is forgotten, clicking ``Forgot Password?`` results in the Forgot ``Password Page`` (:ref:`Image 3<image3>`).
