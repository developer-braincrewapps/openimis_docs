  To access the software, Users must have a valid User Name and Password, provided by the “IMIS Administrator”. In the browser address bar type the URL of the openIMIS instance to request the start page. Login page will appear (:ref:`Image 1<image1>`).

  The full menu is displayed. Clicking on the menu headers will display a sub-menu providing further navigation options. Menus with a blue fore-colour are accessible, while menus with a grey fore-colour are disabled, either due to access rights of a user or unavailable functionality. Below the main menu at the top left-hand corner there is information about the current login user: Login Name, a list of roles acquired by the user and the districts to which the user has access. Logins and roles assignment can be created in the `Users Administration page <#users-administration>`__, custom roles can be created and modified in the `User roles Administration Page <#user-roles-adminstration>`__.
